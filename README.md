## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with Smart Routines, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/furkankurt/smart_routines.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd smart_routines
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

To run the application on your device or emulator, use the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

If you don't have `lcov` installed, you can install it using the following command:

```sh
brew install lcov
```

To generate and view the coverage report, you can use the following commands:

```sh
# Ignore Flutter generated files
lcov --remove coverage/lcov.info 'lib/**/*.g.dart' -o coverage/lcov.info --ignore-errors unused

# Generate and Open Coverage Report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/ && open coverage/index.html
```
The coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` directory and you can view it by opening the `index.html` file.

Or you can use the following command to run the tests and generate the coverage report:

```sh
make flutter_test
```
